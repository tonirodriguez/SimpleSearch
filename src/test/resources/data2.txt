Vehicles parked on drives in Roll Gardens, Gants Hill, have been ticketed as they "slightly obstruct the road's pavement".
The short drives, built in the 1940s, mean most modern cars overhang the pavement.
Redbridge Council said some residents are "clearly obstructing the pavement".
Catherine Meletiou, a resident on the street, said the fines were "crazy".
She added: "It's absolute madness. If the car is not small it's going to come over the driveway and onto the footpath, there's no allowances for that."
